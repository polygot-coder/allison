        		<h1>Anciet Tales</h1>
						<h4>Legend tells of an ocean monster... a beast that lurks in the waters. It is said that this monster ate humans alive, devouring swimmers with teeth like the sharpest sword.</h4>
						<h4>This monster was called a shark. </h4>
						<h4>Hawaiian natives believed that the shark was a god and protecter. The shark, named Kamohoali'i, represented strength, nobility, and immense power, and it deserved to be protected by humans. </h4>
						<h4>However, this was not the only belief that existed. Phonecians, starting at 3000 B.C., painted images on their pottery depicting a shark that ate men whole. A Roman historian described sharks as a ferocious animal that attacked pearl hunters. And Aztecs took extra preparations out of fear to ensure that sharks would not attack them while they were fishing.</h4>
						<h4>Despite the theories, it was extremely rare for anyone to encounter a shark face-to-face. Yet everyone began to believe that sharks where terrifying, man-eating predators, and legends were passed on, by speech and the writing of books.</h4>

				<h1>Hermann Oelrichs</h1>
				<h4>Hermann Oelrichs (1850-1906) was a millionaire and the owner of a shipping company. There were many things Oelrichs was known for, but he made a large difference in the beliefs of sharks.</h4>
				<h4>One day, Oelrichs went sailing with a large group of friends, and he declared that he would be hunting for sharks. Oelrichs believed that the tales of man-eating sharks were a silly myth. He boasted, saying that sharks were nothing but cowardly mice, and that he would frighten away any that surfaced in the waters. </h4>
				<h4>A little while later, the group saw currents disturbing the water. Women began to shriek as everyone saw the deeply dreaded fins rise out of the water. The sharks began to encircle the boat, gliding around the terrified crew. </h4>
        <h4>But Oelrichs would not go back on his word. The people began chanting wildly as the muscular Oelrichs dove into the waves. He splashed wildly in the midst of the sharks, screaming and hollering and yelling at the sharks.</h4>
        <h4>Do you know what the sharks did?</h4>
        <h4>They fled, away from the turbulent Oelrichs and into the depths of the sea.</h4>
        <h4>It was <strong>UNBELIEVEABLE</strong> for those on the Hildegard. The storyspread like a wildfire-- in newpapers, by people hysterically telling each other, "Hermann Oelrichs has scared away the sharks!!!" "The shark is no matach for man!!!" Now everyone believed that sharks were absolutely harmless. They all agreed: man-eating sharks are just are ridiculous tale. </h4>
        <h4>Perhaps the sharks weren't interested, or they were wise enough to not try to eat something that suddenly plopped into the water. Or maybe they weren't hungry. But it didn't matter. No fear whatsoever was induced at the mention of the shark's name.</h4>

               <h1>The Shark Attacks of 1916</h1>
              <h4>And then 1916 happened.</h4>
              <h4>It was all too sudden. One day, when there were people swimming on the shore of New Jersey, a shark began to rise out of the water. But it wasn't eeriely, smoothly gliding across the water. It was leaving a bubbling, snow-white, foamy trail behind it. People began to cautiously rise out of the water, unsure of what to make of it.</h4>
              <h4>And then it striked</h4>
              <h4>People began shrieking and wailing as the shark mauled a young man, name Charles Vascant. Blood began to redden the frothing ocean waters. Lifeguards managed to rescue the man, but he died shortly after from his fatal injuries.</h4>
              <h4>And then, five days later, Charles Bruder was surrounded by a shark. It ripped of his legs and maimed to rest of his body. He lived long enough to tell the lifeguards how he had felt, "... as if rough sandpaper was scraping me (describing how the shark's skin felt like)." Then he soon died out of massive blood loss.</h4>
              <h4>When people who weren't at the scene saw the newpapers' top stories, they could believe it. Some people laughed out loud and disregarded this "hoax." Others simply shook their heads in utter bewilderment. No one could bring themselves to accept these shark attack actually happened.</h4>
              <h4>But they <strong>did</strong>.</h4>
              <h4>Imagine a bunny murdering several lions, or worms devouring us alive. Imagine a disasterous event occuring that goes against the laws of basic science. It would be horrifying and confusing and devestating, depending on who you are and what you think.</h4>
              <h4>And it only got even more extreme</h4>
              <h4>Days later, 10-year-old Lester Stillwell was swimming in Matawan Creek with his friends. It only took one glimpse of the dark fin to send the group careening out of the water. But Lester wasn't quick enough. The shark sank its teeth into the boy, mauling and devouring him. A man, Stanley Fisher, was also killed that same day. He was trying to rescue Lester, but he failed. </h4>
              <h4>And then Joseph Dunn, a twelve-year-old, was attacked by the shark farther up the creek. He was the first survivor in the sequence of shark attacks, being miraculously rescued, but a huge portion of his leg was ripped off. If he wasn't rescued in time, he would be dead.</h4>
              <h4>Because Joseph Dunn was living proof, people began to belive that the shark attacks were real. They began to react. The creek and ocean were abandoned. Some people were bold enough to toss dynamite into the water, hoping to frighten away the sharks.</h4>
              <h4>And, finally, President Woodrow Wilson called a Cabient meeting. He agreed to give utmost support and "drive away all the ferocious man-eating sharks which have been making prey of bathers." </h4>
              <h4>The entire country was terrified, but the one thing was clear: Sharks were perfectly capable of attacking humans</h4>
              <h4>...</h4>

					<h1> Present Science </h1>
          <h4> Thanks to shark biologists, ichthyologists (scientist who study fish), divers, and advancing technology and experience, we know more facts about sharks and their behavior than we did in the past. Here are some things that researchers have found.</h4>
          <h2> Shark Behavior (Still a Great Mystery...)</h2>
          <ul> <h4>
            <li> Sharks are another animal species that are proving the intelligence of nature: Sharks can be seen working together to solve problems, such as carrying a dead animal or seeing is a foriegn animal or human is dangerous</li>
            <li> Larger sharks will eat smaller ones as they would any other prey, whether they belong in the same pack or not </li>
              <li> Some species of sharks are capable of "sleeping," though with their eyes open and refreshing their oxygen supply. Others keep half of their brain awake and active, and still others are forced to keep active</li>
